# Recurrent-neural-networks-in-speech-recognition
This project uses RNNs for speech recognition from audio files and text data. LSTM, RNN, and GRU models are trained on preprocessed data and evaluated using loss, accuracy, and f1-score metrics. The best model is chosen and some output samples are reported.
